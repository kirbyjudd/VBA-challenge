# VBA-challenge
VBA Module 2 Challenge

For this VBA-challenge I had to create a script using VBA that would loop through a large amount of excel stock data and output the:

1. Ticker Symbol
2. Yearly Change (from the opening price at the beginning of a year to the closing price at the end of the year)
3. Percentage Change (from the opening price at the beginning of a year to the closing price at the end of the year)
4. Total Stock Volume

I also had to return the stock that had the Greatest % increase, Greatest % decrease, and Greatest total volume.

The script had to be sure to loop through and run on every excel worksheet at once. 

Conditional formatting was added to the yearly change and percent change columns to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

The script files are located in the "VBA script files" folder and yearly multi-year stock data screenshots are located in the "Result Screenshots" folder.
